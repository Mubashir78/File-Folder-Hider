# File Folder Hider (with Dialog Box)
 A python GUI script (made with Tkinter) for semi-automating the process of attributing +h, +s & +r to files/folders, and removing them as well. Thus it helps in hiding files and/or folders easily. (***WINDOWS ONLY!***)

# Purpose/Usage
 To hide and unhide local files and folders atleast from **File Explorer**.

 # How To Use It
 If you have Python and any IDE like VSCode installed, then you can copy the whole *File Folder Hider.py* script and paste it into any empty .py file and you may name it the same, **or** you can extract *File Folder Hider.rar* to a suitable path/directory and create a shortcut to *File Folder Hider.exe* present inside the *File Folder Hider* folder.
 
 The reason for not having a single executable anymore is that having the imported libraries already extracted boosts the startup time of the program, meaning it will open much quicker as compared to a single executable.
 
 If you are using the program for the first time **OR** there is no *passw.pass* file present in the program's current working directory, it will ask you to create a new **Master Password**. The master password is used to access File_Folder_Hider. In case you ever forget your Master Password, you can opt in to enter your email address alongside creating/changing the Master Password which will send you a recovery code on **Gmail only for now**, **OR** you can choose not to opt in and continue using the program without the **Master Password Recovery** feature. Choose what suits you the best.

 Upon creating/entering the Master Password, you will be greeted with a main menu dialog box. Pick whether you want to hide something, unhide something, show and check the log or to clear it, or to change the Master Password. The program will show you the rest.
