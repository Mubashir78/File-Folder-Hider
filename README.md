# File Folder Hider (with Dialog Box)
 A python GUI script (made with Tkinter) for semi-automating the process of attributing +h, +s & +r to files/folders, and removing them as well. Thus it helps in hiding files and/or folders easily. (***WINDOWS ONLY!***)

# Purpose/Usage
 To hide and unhide local files and folders atleast from **File Explorer**.

 # How To Use It
 Run *File_Folder_Hider.exe*. If you are using the program for the first time **OR** there is no *passw.pass* file present in the program's current working directory, it will  ask you to create a new **master password**. The master password is used to access File_Folder_Hider.**Currently**, without the master password, the program is not usable. The only solution is, **currently**, to delete the passw.pass file located in the same directory as the program to *"reset*.

 **IMPORTANT**: Currently, you *cannot* exit the program when it is asking you for your master password due to simplicity of the dialog box. I will make a custom dialog box to fix that issue soon. For the time being, the best solution is to end the program from the Task Manager.

 Upon creating/entering the master password, you will be greeted with a main menu dialog box. Pick whether you want to hide something, unhide something, show and check the log or to clear it. The program will show you the rest.
